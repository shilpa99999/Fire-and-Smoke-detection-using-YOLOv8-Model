# Fire-and-Smoke-detection-using-YOLOv8-Model
# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a fire and smoke detection system using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model. The project leverages the latest advancements in object detection to identify and locate fire and smoke in images and video streams in real-time. This tool can be crucial for early fire detection in surveillance systems, ensuring prompt response and minimizing damage.

# Features
Real-time Detection: Detects fire and smoke in real-time using video feeds.

High Accuracy: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for high precision and recall rates.

Easy Integration: Can be integrated with various surveillance systems and IoT devices.

Scalable: Capable of handling multiple video streams simultaneously.

Alerts: Configurable alerts for detected fire and smoke events.
